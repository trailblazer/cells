h2. 3.8.8

* Maintenance release.

h2. 3.8.7

* Cells runs with Rails 4.

h2. 3.8.6

* @cell/base@ can now be required without trouble.
* Generated test files now respect namespaced cells.

h2. 3.8.5

* Added @Cell::Rails::HelperAPI@ module to provide the entire Rails view "API" (quotes on purpose!) in cells running completely outside of Rails. This makes it possible to use gems like simple_form in any Ruby environment, especially interesting for people using Sinatra, webmachine, etc.
* Moved @Caching.expire_cache_key@ to @Rails@. Use @Caching.expire_cache_key_for(key, cache_store, ..)@ if you want to expire caches outside of Rails.

h2. 3.8.4

* Added @Cell::Rack@ for request-dependent Cells. This is also the new base class for @Cells::Rails@.
* Removed deprecation warning from @TestCase#cell@ as it's signature is not deprecated.
* Added the @base_cell_class@ config option to generator for specifying an alternative base class.

h2. 3.8.3

* Added @Engines.existent_directories_for@ to prevent Rails 3.0 from crashing when it detects engines. 

h2. 3.8.2

* Engines should work in Rails 3.0 now, too.

h2. 3.8.1

* Make it work with Rails 3.2 by removing deprecated stuff.

h2. 3.8.0

* @Cell::Base@ got rid of the controller dependency. If you want the @ActionController@ instance around in your cell, use @Cell::Rails@ - this should be the default in a standard Rails setup. However, if you plan on using a Cell in a Rack middleware or don't need the controller, use @Cell::Base@.
* New API (note that @controller@ isn't the first argument anymore):
** @Rails.create_cell_for(name, controller)@
** @Rails.render_cell_for(name, state, controller, *args)@
* Moved builder methods to @Cell::Builder@ module. 
* @DEFAULT_VIEW_PATHS@ is now in @Cell::Base@.
* Removed the monkey-patch that made state-args work in Rails <= 3.0.3. Upgrade to +3.0.4.

h2. 3.7.1

* Works with Rails 3.2, too. Hopefully.

h2. 3.7.0

h3. Changes
  * Cache settings using @Base.cache@ are now inherited.
  * Removed <code>@opts</code>.
  * Removed @#options@ in favor of state-args. If you still want the old behaviour, include the @Deprecations@ module in your cell.
  * The build process is now instantly delegated to Base.build_for on the concrete cell class.

h2. 3.6.8

h3. Changes
  * Removed <code>@opts</code>.
  * Deprecated @#options@ in favour of state-args. 

h2. 3.6.7

h3. Changes
  * Added @view_assigns@ to TestCase. 
  
h2. 3.6.6

h3. Changes
  * Added the @:format@ option for @#render@ which should be used with caution. Sorry for that.
  * Removed the useless @layouts/@ view path from Cell::Base. 

h2. 3.6.5

h3. Bugfixes
  * `Cell::TestCase#invoke` now properly accepts state-args.

h3. Changes
  * Added the `:if` option to `Base.cache` which allows adding a conditional proc or instance method to the cache definition. If it doesn't return true, caching for that state is skipped. 


h2. 3.6.4

h3. Bugfixes
  * Fixes @ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)@ in @#render_cell@ for Ruby 1.8.


h2. 3.6.3

h3. Bugfixes
  * [Rails 3.0] Helpers are now properly included (only once). Thanks to [paneq] for a fix.
  * `#url_options` in the Metal module is now delegated to `parent_controller` which propagates global URL setting like relative URLs to your cells.

h3. Changes
  * `cells/test_case` is no longer required as it should be loaded automatically.


h2. 3.6.2

h3. Bugfixes
  * Fixed cells.gemspec to allow Rails 3.x.

h2. 3.6.1

h3. Changes
  * Added the @:format@ option allowing @#render@ to set different template types, e.g. @render :format => :json@.


h2. 3.6.0

h3. Changes
  * Cells runs with Rails 3.0 and 3.1.


h2. 3.5.6

h3. Changes
  * Added a generator for slim. Use it with `-e slim` when generating.


h2. 3.5.5
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * The generator now places views of namespaced cells into the correct directory. E.g. `rails g Blog::Post display` puts views to `app/cells/blog/post/display.html.erb`.

h3. Changes
  * Gem dependencies changed, we now require @actionpack@ and @railties@ >= 3.0.0 instead of @rails@.


h2. 3.5.4
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * state-args work even if your state method receives optional arguments or default values, like @def show(user, age=18)@.

h3. Changes

  * Cell::Base.view_paths is now setup in an initializer. If you do scary stuff with view_paths this might lead to scary problems.
  * Cells::DEFAULT_VIEW_PATHS is now Cell::Base::DEFAULT_VIEW_PATHS. Note that Cells will set its view_paths to DEFAULT_VIEW_PATHS at initialization time. If you want to alter the view_paths, use Base.append_view_path and friends in a separate initializer.


h2. 3.5.2
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Controller#render_cell now accepts multiple args as options.

h3. Changes
  * Caching versioners now can accept state-args or options from the #render_cell call. This way, you don't have to access #options at all anymore.


h2. 3.5.1

  * No longer pass an explicit Proc but a versioner block to @Cell.Base.cache@. Example: @cache :show do "v1" end@
  * Caching.cache_key_for now uses @ActiveSupport::Cache.expand_cache_key@. Consequently, a key which used to be like @"cells/director/count/a=1/b=2"@ now is @cells/director/count/a=1&b=2@ and so on. Be warned that this might break your home-made cache expiry.
  * Controller#expire_cell_state now expects the cell class as first arg. Example: @expire_cell_state(DirectorCell, :count)@
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Passing options to @render :state@ in views finally works: @render({:state => :list_item}, item, i)@


h2. 3.5.0

h3. Changes
  * Deprecated @opts, use #options now.
  * Added state-args. State methods can now receive the options as method arguments. This should be the prefered way of parameter exchange with the outer world.
  * #params, #request, and #config is now delegated to @parent_controller. 
  * The generator now is invoked as @rails g cell ...@
    * The `--haml` option is no longer available.
    * The `-t` option now is compatible with the rest of rails generators, now it is used as alias for `--test-framework`. Use the `-e` option	as an alias of `--template-engine`
    Thanks to Jorge Calás Lozano <calas@qvitta.net> for patching this in the most reasonable manner i could imagine.
  * Privatized @#find_family_view_for_state@, @#render_view_for@, and all *ize methods in Cell::Rails.
  * New signature: @#render_view_for(state, *args)@
  
h2. 3.4.4

h3. Changes
  * Cells.setup now yields Cell::Base, so you can really call append_view_path and friends here.
  * added Cell::Base.build for streamlining the process of deciders around #render_cell, "see here":http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2010/12/pragmatic-rails-thoughts-on-views-inheritance-view-inheritance-and-rails-304
  * added TestCase#in_view to test helpers in a real cell view.
  

h2. 3.4.3

h3. Changes
  * #render_cell now accepts a block which yields the cell instance before rendering.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * We no longer use TestTaskWithoutDescription in our rake tasks.
